# CB_Sentiment_Forecasting
This project studies whether the language in Federal Reserve and European Central Bank speeches carries predictive signals for interest-rate changes beyond traditional macro indicators. We fine-tune RoBERTa classifiers and run aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), then inject the best NLP signal into a SARIMAX model alongside macro variables.
